# Smart_Door_Lock_System_Using_Atmega32
The Smart Door Lock System is a secure, efficient, and user-friendly password-based locking mechanism designed for modern home security. Built around the ATmega16 microcontroller, this project integrates a 4x4 keypad for password input, an LCD interfaced via I2C for real-time feedback, and a servo motor for locking and unlocking the door.

# Key Features:

## Password Authentication: Users enter passwords through the keypad for secure access.
## Real-Time Feedback: System status is displayed on an LCD, simplifying user interaction.
## Automated Locking/Unlocking: A servo motor physically locks or unlocks the door upon successful authentication.
## Security Timeout: Prevents unauthorized access by locking the system after three failed password attempts.
## Efficient Design: Utilizes the PCF8574 I/O expander for I2C communication, minimizing wiring and optimizing pin usage.

This project demonstrates the practical application of embedded systems to enhance residential security while ensuring scalability, cost-effectiveness, and ease of use. Perfect for DIY enthusiasts, students, and developers interested in embedded system design.
